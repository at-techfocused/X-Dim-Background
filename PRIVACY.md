# Privacy Policy — X Dim Background

**Last updated:** February 13, 2026

## Summary

X Dim Background does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Period.

## Data Collection

This extension collects **zero** user data. Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected
- **No browsing history** is tracked
- **No analytics or telemetry** is sent
- **No cookies** are set or read (beyond what X/Twitter sets itself)
- **No network requests** are made by the extension
- **No third-party services** are contacted

## Local Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to store a single boolean value (`enabled: true/false`) that remembers whether you have toggled the Dim theme on or off. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not synced across devices
- Is not accessible to any website or third party
- Can be cleared by removing the extension

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `storage` | To remember your on/off preference locally |
| Host access to `x.com` and `twitter.com` | To inject the Dim theme CSS on those sites only |

No other permissions are requested.

## Open Source

The entire source code is publicly available on GitHub. You can read every line of code the extension runs:
